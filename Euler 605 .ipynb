    "## Pairwise Coin-Tossing Game\n",
    "**Problem 605 **\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an $n$-player game played in consecutive pairs: Round 1 takes place between players 1 and 2, round 2 takes place between players 2 and 3, and so on and so forth, all the way up to round $n$, which takes place between players $n$ and 1. Then round $n+1$ takes place between players 1 and 2 as the entire cycle starts again.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, during round $r$, player $((râˆ’1) \\textrm{ mod } n)+1$ faces off against player $(r \\textrm{ mod } n)+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "During each round, a fair coin is tossed to decide which of the two players wins that round. If any given player wins both rounds $r$ and $r+1$, then that player wins the entire game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $P_n(k)$ be the probability that player $k$ wins in an $n$-player game, in the form of a reduced fraction. For example, $P_3(1)$=$12/49$ and $P_6(2)=368/1323$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $M_n(k)$ be the product of the reduced numerator and denominator of $P_n(k)$. For example, $M_3(1)=588$ and $M_6(2)=486864$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the last 88 digits of M108+7(104+7)M108+7(104+7)."
